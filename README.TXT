A Torrent of Tetrominos

Author: John Nelson

This is the source code for the game A Torrent of Tetrominos.
This project is my attempt to recreate a standalone version of a 
game I made with a fellow developer, Alex Guerra, in the Perlenspiel game engine.
The original game was called Attack of the Tetrominoes and was a web based
game developed in Brian Moriarty's Perlenspiel game engine.

Wanting an updated version of the game with updated graphics, input, and
offline capability, I decided to recreate it in Java.  This source code
contains a very small and simple game engine required for running the
game code created alongside it. The engine is entirely Monolithic and
could only be used for this game.

The game is built with Java Swing elements for visuals and runs as an
executable Jar file.  So long as users have java installed on their computer,
they can play the game.
